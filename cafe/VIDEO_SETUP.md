To complete the Cafe Italia landing page, you need to add the background video file:

1. **Download the video**: Get the video file `5792372_Coll_wavebreak_Waiter_1920x1080.mp4`
2. **Place the video**: Put the video file in the `public` folder of your React app
3. **File path**: The video should be located at `public/5792372_Coll_wavebreak_Waiter_1920x1080.mp4`

## Video Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 pixels

## Fallback

If the video doesn't load, the page will show a beautiful gradient background with a coffee icon as a fallback.
